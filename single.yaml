      Read the PDF file and find the courses that match the student query: {query}
      Consider prerequisites and corequisites for each course when making recommendations.
      Pre-requisite: Classes you must take prior to the specific class.
      Co-requisite: Classes you can take along with the desired class if you have not taken them before.
      For example, suppose someone took EMT1111, EMT1150, ENG1101 so far.
      As they have not completed all classes needed for starting second-semester classes,
      they cannot take any second-semester classes until they complete EMT1120, EMT1130, and some general education classes like ENG, MAT, PHY for which no prerequisites are needed or the student already took prerequisites.
      Provide a user-friendly but straightforward response and avoid unnecessary information.
    expected_output: "A list or description of courses matching the student query, including course name, prerequisites, and corequisites. Be accurate and concise."
